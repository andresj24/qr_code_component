## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I selected this project to resume my preparation in web development and programming after having abandoned it for a few years.

In this project I was able to review basic concepts related to HTML5 and CSS, among them: HTML tags, content structuring, selectors and classes to edit styles and in this way obtain a result that is as similar as possible to the proposed design.

### Continued development

Soon I will continue working on projects of this type to continue practicing the fundamentals and later I will select more complex projects that include the use of the JavaScript language, database, and more, until I create a complete web application.
